# Web Security Academy

This repository is where I upload write-ups for solved labs from PortSwigger's Web Security Academy!

PortSwigger maintains a library of content and different labs for aspiring web security experts to learn, practice, demonstrate, and test their skills. It's the perfect starting point for anyone who is new to web security or wants to learn more. The labs and their corresponding learning material cover different types of web application security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), XML external entity injection (XXE), and many, many more. Make an account on [PortSwigger's site](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path) and download your preferred version of Burp Suite, Community (free) or Professional (paid subscription) to get started! Even if you're completely new to web security, this is one of the most valuable free learning resources at your disposal.
