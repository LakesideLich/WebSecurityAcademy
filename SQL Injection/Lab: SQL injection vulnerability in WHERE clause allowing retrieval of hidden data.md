# Problem Statement
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following: 
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products. 
# Solution
Due to knowing the exact query carried out by the SQL database, this lab is fairly straightforward. In Structured Query Language (SQL), the single quote ' indicates the beginning or end of a string. Comments in SQL are usually implemented either as a double-dash sequence -- or as a pound sign / hashtag #. The <i>injection point</i> of a query is the portion of the query of that an attacker, in this case, me or you, controls. For this lab, the injection point occurs in the string relating to a category of product. The goal is to make the application show us unreleased products. We can use the single quote ' as a string terminator and a comment to remove the AND clause restricting our query. Between the single quote and the comment, we will add an OR statement that always evaluates to 'True', so the application returns every product in the "products" table.
