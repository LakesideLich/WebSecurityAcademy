# Problem Statement

 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user. 

# Solution

Knowing that the objective of this lab is to bypass the login functionality directly, let's start by navigating to the login page. You can do this by clicking on the "My Account" button, which will send you to the /login endpoint.

We land on a page with a standard login form comprised of a username and password. We know that the goal is to login as the 'administrator' user, so let's consider what the SQL query executing on the server might look like:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='%' AND password='%'
```

Where the percent signs are placeholders for the username and password. 

Assuming that user input is not properly escaped, we can try an input like the following to log in as the administrator. 

<b>username: administrator'-- <br>
password: password </b>

Keep in mind that the password can be any string that meets input validation criteria. The idea of this input is to comment out the password check of the SQL query, bypassing the login. Let's try it:

After selecting the "login" button, we see the following page:

showing us the home page for the administrator user, and a banner indicating we have solved the lab. Most login bypasses you come across in the wild may not be this simple, but this is a basic example to show that it can be done. Try to think to yourself, if you were a developer responsible for this site, how would you resolve this security issue?
