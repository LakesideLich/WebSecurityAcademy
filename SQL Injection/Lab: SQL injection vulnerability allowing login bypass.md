# Problem Statement

 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user. 

# Solution

Knowing that the objective of this lab is to bypass the login functionality directly, let's start by navigating to the login page. You can do this by clicking on the "My Account" button, which will send you to the /login endpoint.

We land on a page with a standard login form comprised of a username and password. We know that the goal is to login as the 'administrator' user, so let's consider what the SQL query executing on the server might look like:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='%' AND password='%'
```

Where the percent signs are placeholders for the username and password. 

Assuming that user input is not properly escaped, we can try an input like the following to log in as the administrator. 

<b>username: administrator'--\n 
password: password </b>
