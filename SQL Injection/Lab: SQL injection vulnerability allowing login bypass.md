# Problem Statement

 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user. 

# Solution

Knowing that the objective of this lab is to bypass the login functionality directly, let's start by navigating to the login page. You can do this by clicking on the "My Account" button, which will send you to the /login endpoint.
